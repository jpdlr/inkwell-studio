# Claude Project Notes

## Purpose
Single-page editorial portfolio site built with React + Vite. Keep updates minimalist and content-focused.

## Commands
```bash
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run test
npm run lint
```

## Architecture
- `src/App.jsx`: layout and content sections
- `src/styles.css`: design system, animations, and layout styles
- `src/App.test.jsx`: baseline test

## Design constraints
- Avoid purple hues; keep to teal/tangerine neutrals.
- Preserve generous whitespace and soft gradients.
- Prefer CSS-only effects over heavy JS.
